                <p>Hi there! I’m a passionate software developer with a deep love for technology and problem-solving. Born in Chandler, raised in Surprise, and now thriving in Tucson, Arizona, I’ve always been captivated by the intersection of logic, creativity, and innovation. My journey into the tech world led me to pursue a Computer Science degree at the University of Arizona, where I’ve been developing a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and system design. I’m dedicated to completing my degree, as I believe it’s a cornerstone for my continuous growth as a developer.</p>
                <p>My curiosity extends beyond just coding—whether it’s diving into video games, challenging myself with intricate puzzles, or exploring cutting-edge ideas, I’m always seeking to grow intellectually. More recently, my life has taken on an exciting new dimension: fatherhood. My son, Damian, inspires me every day to be the best version of myself, both personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>Professionally, I am actively seeking opportunities in the tech industry with a particular focus on software development. I enjoy creating practical and innovative solutions through code, and I’ve been sharpening my skills by working on personal projects, including game development using Unity. For me, hands-on projects are not just a way to learn but a means to turn ideas into reality.</p>
                <p>Collaboration is at the heart of my work ethic. I thrive in team-oriented settings where diverse perspectives and technical expertise come together to build impactful products. Whether I’m contributing to a team project or taking the lead on a solo endeavor, I’m driven by a desire to create meaningful software that solves real-world problems.</p>    
                <p>I’m excited about what the future holds and look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals who share my passion for technology and innovation. Let’s create something incredible together!</p>
